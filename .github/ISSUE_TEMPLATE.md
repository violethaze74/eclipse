Before reporting a possible bug:

1. Please ensure you are running the latest version of CT4E with _Help > Check for Updates_.

2. If the problem occurs when you deploy or after the application has been deployed,
try deploying from the command line using `gcloud` or Maven. 
If the problem does not go away, then the issue is very likely
not with Cloud Tools for Eclipse.
